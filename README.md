## Introduction

Lobster Fishing League is an on-chain game where players can mint Lobster Pots, catch Common Red Lobsters, and participate in various fishing activities. The game is built on the Base blockchain, leveraging the power of smart contracts to create a transparent and fun gaming experience.

## Features

- Mint unique Lobster Pot NFTs
- Fish for Common Red Lobsters (ERC20 tokens)
- Cooldown mechanics for balanced gameplay
- Expandable system for new equipment, lobster types, and fishing spots
- Fully on-chain gameplay logic

## Contract Overview

The game consists of three main smart contracts that are built on interfaces to allow for new types of contracts to be developed over time:

1. **CommonRedLobsterToken (CRL)**: An ERC20 token representing the Common Red Lobsters caught in the game.
2. **LobsterPotNFT**: An ERC721 token representing the Lobster Pots used for fishing.
3. **FishingSpot**: The main game contract where players can fish for lobsters.

## How It Works

1. Players mint a LobsterPotNFT to start playing.
2. With a LobsterPotNFT, players can fish at FishingSpot locations.
3. Successful fishing attempts reward players with CommonRedLobsterTokens (CRL).
4. FishingSpots are periodically baited with CRL tokens to maintain the lobster population.
5. Players can trade their CRL tokens or use them in future game expansions.

## Getting Started

To start playing:

1. Connect your wallet to the [Lobster Fishing League dApp](https://lobsterfishingleague.com).
2. Ensure you have some ETH on the Base network for gas fees and minting.
3. Mint a LobsterPotNFT from the dApp interface.
4. Navigate to a FishingSpot and start fishing!
5. Wait for the cooldown period between fishing attempts.
6. Collect your CRL tokens and watch your balance grow!

## Deployment

The contracts are deployed on the Base blockchain:

- CommonRedLobsterToken: `0xbC69A9e8768746C6E9A4Cf619E0e441EF40E9ba9`
- LobsterPotNFT: `0x721552FdBB7419554Db03C694f22f2a7DAeFad3C`
